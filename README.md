### Description
Wedding Book is a new way to consume wedding-focused content. Like our sister platform, Catlick, it relies on some fundamental principles. First, some people don't know what they are looking for when they get on the internet. They want to be inspired. Machine learning algorithms show you what you like based on what they already know about you. Ironically enough, most people don't have their dream wedding more than a couple of times in one lifetime. Machine learning algorithms will never know enough about you to give you quality content when it comes to planning your wedding. Don't believe me? Just search for wedding related content in your favorite search engine. You'll notice: there just isn't relevant content. This is bad for people planning their wedding but even worse for people trying to get inspired.  

Second, the internet has become a place where money matters most. You never know if you want a dress because its everything you've ever dreamed of or because some clever marketing gimmick manipulated you. No one should have the one day they've been thinking about be ruined to line someone else's pocket book. It's unconscionable. There are a ton of lessons to be learned from people who have planned their weddings and figured out where you can cut costs to maximize your bottom line. Unfortunately, those lessons are usually difficult to find because, to go back to the original point, you have to search for them with your favorite search engine. Talk about hitting all the irony check-boxes.

Let's change the way we consume content. Wedding Book is free. As the project increases and content increases, so does everyone's ability to plan the wedding of their dreams - and make it a reality. Let's get inspired and let's get you what you've always wanted because there are only so many special days to make life standstill for you and your significant other.
